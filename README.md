# Clustering Users

This task is about using unsupervised learning to segment people (your data) into groups.
Given a csv file that contains information about users , the code will try to tell how much these people are similar between them without any predefined class or creteria.

## to start
To use Kmeans clustering , we need to work with numerical data.
If you are using categorical data -which is my case here- consider converting them into numerical data with the function I defined in the code.
